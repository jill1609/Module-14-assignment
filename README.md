### Plot for SVC model from support vector machine (SVM) learning method ###
![predictions_df plot](predictions_df_plot.png) 

The SVC model had a precision value of 56% for positive stock returns, and a precison of 43% for negative stock returns.

In case of recall values, positive stock returns have a recall of 96%, whilst negative returns have a recall value of 4% as per the SVC model.

### Plot for Logistic Regression model ###

 The Logistic Regression model had a precison of 56% for positive stock returns, whilst for negative stock returns the precision was 44%.

 In case of recall values, the positive stock returns had recall of 66%, and negative stock returns has recall of 33%.

>Question: 

**Did this new model perform better or worse than the provided baseline model? Did this new model perform better or worse than your tuned trading algorithm?**

>Answer: 

**It should be noted that SVC Model has an accuracy of 55%. And Logistic Regression model has an accuracy of 52%.** 

**Therefore, the baseline model (SVC model) has performed better than the new model (Logistic Regression model) with tuned trading algorithm.**
